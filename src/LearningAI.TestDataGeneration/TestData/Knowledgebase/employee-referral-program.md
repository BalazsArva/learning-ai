# Employee Referral Program

## Purpose
The company values the contributions of its employees and believes that great people know great people. To attract top talent and reward employees for helping build our team, we have established an Employee Referral Program. This program allows employees to refer qualified candidates for open positions and receive a bonus if their referral is hired.

3. **Candidate Review:** The HR team will review the referred candidate’s application and contact them if they meet the qualifications for the position.
4. **Bonus Eligibility:** If the referred candidate is hired and successfully completes the probationary period, the referring employee will receive a referral bonus.
